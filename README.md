In the context of the coursework, we worked with a set of real data related to the positions of ships in Piraeus and the Saronic Gulf, as transmitted by the ships and collected by appropriate antennas through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Specifically, the dataset we used consists of three (3) CSV files, one for each table of the DB. In particular, the first file (Positions.csv) contains ship positions for the period 01/08/2019 - 30/08/2019, the second (Vessels.csv) contains static information about the ships (type and flag) and, finally, the third (VesselTypes.csv) contains a short description of the different types of ships. 

• Positions (id, t, lon, lat, heading, course, speed, vessel_id) // the spots of the ships

• Vessels (id, flag, type) // information about the ships

• VesselTypes (code, description) // the types of ships
